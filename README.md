# Air-Drawn Mathematical Expression Recognition System

An innovative AI-powered system that allows users to draw mathematical expressions in the air using hand gestures. The system captures the drawing path, converts it into LaTeX format, and supports the interpretation and solving of complex mathematical problems — all without touching a screen or keyboard.

## 🚀 Features

- ✍️ **Air Gesture Drawing**  
  Natural handwriting-like experience for drawing math expressions in the air.

- 🖼️ **Canvas-Based Visualization**  
  Real-time on-screen rendering of air-drawn input for user clarity and feedback.

- 🧠 **Expression Labeling with LaTeX Support**  
  Users can input LaTeX ground truth corresponding to the drawn expression for accurate dataset creation.

- 📊 **Dataset Generation for AI Model Training**  
  Drawn trajectories and LaTeX labels are saved for model training and performance evaluation.

- 🧮 **Complex Mathematical Expression Recognition**  
  Built to support a wide range of mathematical constructs:
  - Arithmetic operations
  - Algebraic expressions
  - Trigonometric functions
  - Calculus equations (derivatives, integrals)
  - Matrices, summations, limits, and more

- 🤖 **AI-Ready Pipeline**  
  Outputs data in structured format compatible with machine learning workflows for expression recognition.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Tkinter** – For interactive GUI
- **OpenCV & NumPy** – For image and coordinate processing
- **Custom Tracking Algorithm** – For gesture-to-drawing translation

## 🏁 How It Works

1. The user draws a math expression in the air.
2. The trajectory is captured and visualized on a canvas.
3. A corresponding LaTeX label is manually input by the user.
4. The system stores both the trajectory and the LaTeX code as a training pair.
5. These labeled samples will be used to train a recognition model capable of:
   - Interpreting new air-drawn expressions
   - Rendering LaTeX output
   - Solving mathematical expressions (future phase)

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Hands-free mathematical input in AR/VR environments
- Smart classroom applications for live equation solving
- Accessibility solutions for individuals with motor disabilities
- Intelligent tutoring systems with gesture input
