WELCOME TO AIR DRAWN MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION RECOGNISION SYSTEM

Have you ever thought of writing mathematical expression in air and your system will recognise
and solve complex maths problem like calculus.

So this is system is designed to solve this.In air we can write any mathematical
expression and our system will recognise by evaluating its trajectories and it will
solve the expression.

I have uploaded a sample video how it works
